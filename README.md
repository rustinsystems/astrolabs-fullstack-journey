# 🚀 Full-Stack Engineering Journey (Astrolabs Bootcamp)

> **From "Hello World" to Production Deployment.**

This repository serves as a monorepo archive of my progression through the Astrolabs Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It documents the evolution of my skills from basic HTML/CSS landing pages to complex MERN stack applications and Next.js implementations.

This journey culminated in the immediate deployment of a commercial production platform for a real-world client, proving the transferability of these skills to the market.

## 📂 Project Roadmap

The repository is structured chronologically to demonstrate the learning curve:

| Directory | Stack | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01-landing-page** | HTML5 / CSS3 | Initial static landing page focusing on semantic markup and layout. |
| **02-assignment-1** | JavaScript | Logic scripting and DOM manipulation fundamentals. |
| **03-ecommerce-backend** | Node.js / Express | REST API architecture, MongoDB integration, and JWT authentication. |
| **04-ecommerce-frontend** | React.js | Component-based UI, state management, and API consumption. |
| **05-final-project** | **MERN Stack** | **Capstone: "Project Capture Beauty"** - A full-stack photography marketplace featuring user auth, database integration, and responsive design. |
| **06-post-course-practice** | Next.js / Framer | Continuous learning modules including Framer Motion animations, MUI experiments, and Next.js dashboards. |
